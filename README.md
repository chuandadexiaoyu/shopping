shopping
=================

This is a shopping list web app for a business. I hope to make it fully buzzword compliant :-) Laravel 4, a RESTful api, JSON on the front-end, tested with phpunit, etc. 

Staff members fill out things they would like to buy during the week (including rough estimates of prices, locations where they think items can be bought, etc.). Once per week, a designated buyer goes out on a shopping run to make all of the requested purchases.

The main application is split into two components:
  api - a RESTful JSON API
  ui  - User interface; all interactions with users
  
Documentation about specific parts of the system are in the docs folder.
